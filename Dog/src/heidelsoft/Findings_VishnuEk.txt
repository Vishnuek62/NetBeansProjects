Findings
--------------
Opened these 2 files in netbeans. I got some compilations errors. Some of them solved in my way and created extra java files for code simplicity and refactor.

Changed items

1. code formatted using netbeans IDE
2. added java doc of each method  when third party developer reading the java doc  it can easy to understand what method can do.
3. changed inner classes to external POJO classes(DTO) it contains setter and getter. so in future we can easy to add new functionality.
4. Character is changed to String for the variable "activeClass"
5. If a method contains 20 lines , better to create submethods and call the method.
6. Used Java 7,8 properties
7. local variable inside method can declared as final. make sure when do it
8. newFileArchive.fields = new ArrayList<MyDto.ArchiveField>();
this statement contain angular brackets.
Since Java 7 , it can write this 
List<String> sampleList = new ArrayList<>(); 

9. use java code conventions (variables starts with small letter)(better is ,class name is not contains underscore)
10. If you are using String constants, can declare public static final ..
11. decimal datatype not found in java
12. try with multiple catch can use like this
try
{
 ...
}
catch(Exception1 | Exception2 | Exception3 exe)
{
 ...
}
But, I think written code in AdminController class is better.

13. In my view, a method returns null is not good way of coding.


Also, 
I checked the available storage  through creating the AdminController object. It is not start upload when checking the condition.


Please check my code attached.
